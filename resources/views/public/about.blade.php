              Chikitzo was formed with the aim of helping individuals find the right healthcare and be guided by the right professionals. We are a group of passionate healthcare consultants hailing from different academic backgrounds, and a common goal. Our aim is to create a solution in the healthcare industry that will enable an individual to assess and identify the right treatment for every ailment. We hope to ease the burden and costs involved during an individualâ€™s medical visit, which is oftentimes stressful. Oftentimes, patients and their caretakers are reluctant in making their decisions to avail treatments outside their locality. People typically rely on common recommendations among their friends and relatives. Although, word-of-mouth helps in many cases, it is not always accurate and should not be the deciding factor for treating any ailment. This is where the Chikitzo team comes in handy!
            </p><p>  Chikitzo provides a digital platform that ensures a well-informed patient through transparency of information, and an open platform to express customer satisfaction.
